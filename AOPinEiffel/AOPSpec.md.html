# Connecting
Components can be connected using the right arrow →.

For example, the following will connect a text field you have created (assumed to be stored in the variable text) to stdout.

```bash
text → stdout.
```

The right arrow is polymorphic: in the previous exampe, it connected the two components via their default in and out ports, which happned to be compatible.

The text field can be created as follows:

```
text ← #NSTextField{ #frame: (180@24)  }.
```

Combining these two lines of code creates a complete program that will show a text field and echo the user entered text to the console.

# How to implement the connecting mechanism?

In Eiffel we could implement the connect with an Event_type

For example the previous idea of

```
text -> stdout

```

In eiffel we could create a
simple testcase such as:

Alice connects with Bob.
And bob keeps synchronized with Alice.

~~~ Eiffel
	TEST_ACTION_CELL
			-- can connect and remain in sync
		local
			Alice, Bob: ACTION_CELL [STRING]
		do
			create Alice.put ("")
			create Bob.put ("")

			Alice.connect (agent Bob.put)
			Alice.put ("1st text")

			assert ("bob got updated with ilecs value", Bob.item ~ Alice.item)

			Alice.put ("2nd text")
			assert ("they remain in sync", Bob.item ~ Alice.item)
		end
~~~

With this example we can start thinking about what we need.

## ACTION_CELL

An ACTION_CELL is almost like a CELL,
except that it's updatde method is a little different.
And it is CONNECTABLE to other components

~~~
class
	ACTION_CELL [G]

inherit
	CELL [G]
		redefine
			put
		end
	CONNECTABLE [G]
~~~


It's update value is like the originar (Precursor), but when it finishes it notifies it's listeners.

~~~
	put (v: G)
		-- update value and notify listeners
		do
			Precursor (v)
			tell_listeners (v)
		end
~~~


## What is something CONNECTABLE

Now what defines that something is CONNECTABLE?

it means that you can connect to it.

~~~
feature
	connect(aListener: PROCEDURE [EVENT_DATA])
		require
			not_listening_already: not listeners.has (aListener)
		do
			listeners.extend (aListener)
		ensure
			ready_to_listen: listeners.has (aListener)
		end
~~~

And that you are that the list of listeners.

~~~
feature --collection of listeners
	listeners: ACTION_SEQUENCE [EVENT_DATA]
		attribute
			create Result.default_create
		end
~~~

And that you tell the audience listeners,
when the thing makes the action.

~~~
feature
    -- after upadating tell listeners
    tell_listeners (data: EVENT_DATA)
		do
			listeners.call (data)
		end
~~~

As you can see.
We have actually used two kinds of inheritance in order to implement this pattern.

in ACTION_CELL we have used multiple inheritance. We want it to hove two roles.
One is as a storage of values a CELL
and the other is as CONNECTABLE thing,
that notify it's audience.
